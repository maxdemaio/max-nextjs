Hardware Platform: Low level code --(assembler)--> computer architecture --(digital design)--> CPU, RAM, chipset --(gate logic)--> elementary logic gates --> EE and hardware.

In programming we normally start with how to make a "hello, world" application. We would write this is a high-level programming language. This programming language would be rich with expressions, loops, data types, classes methods, and built in operations. However, what is the underlying implementation of this? The underlying implementation is the "how" and the high-level programming language is the "what".

Programming allows us to have multiple levels of abstraction which lets us forget about the "how". Here I'm going to learn the "how" and through traversing these levels. At each step we can take the last level as given, focus on the current level's implementation, and test that it works and continue.

I'll teach myself about elementary logic gates, ALUs, memory systems, low level programs, computer architecture, assemblers, and finally how to build the [Hack Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_computer). This computer has 3 components and the final product can be connected to a keyboard and a display unit:

- ROM
- CPU
- RAM
