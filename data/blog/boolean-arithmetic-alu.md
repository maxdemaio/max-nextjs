## Binary Numbers

For n bits, you can have 2^n possible binary combinations. With binary we can represent numbers. For example, if you wanted to know the value of "101" of binary in decimal form you would do (2^2 \* 1 + 2^1 \* 0 + 2^0 \* 1).

| Decimal | Binary |
| ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 1      |
| 2       | 10     |
| 3       | 11     |
| 4       | 100    |
