I've always wanted to learn Korean to take my sister who was born in South Korea on a trip there. My goal is to reach a basic level in Korean. This blog contains my language learning progress for 100 days! I'll be using [https://duolingo.com](https://duolingo.com/), [https://youtube.com](https://youtube.com/), and other resources to help me learn. For more info on the challenge definitely check out my Twitter bot, [thelangbot](https://github.com/maxdemaio/thelangbot). With the help of my Twitter bot and the language learning community I'm hoping to achieve my language goals. 가자!

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress:** I received a free year of Duolingo Plus for being a volunteer events host for French! Jumped into learning the Korean alphabet, 한글. Unlike English it's organized into syllable blocks of two to four letters.

**Thoughts:** Learning how syllable blocks sound how to write them and will be beneficial down the line. Knowing how consonants and vowels sound will be helpful despite edge cases.

### Day 2:

**Today's Progress:** Studied Duolingo's "basics 1" course and a little bit of "basics 2". Found a sweet playlist with 100 videos to learn Korean, 멋있습니다! [Billy Go’s Beginner Korean Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx0yyQqkpqo&list=PLbFrQnW0BNMUkAFj4MjYauXBPtO3I9O_k).

**Thoughts:** Before moving on in the Duolingo tree I'm going to try and make the skill/course at least golden or legendary. Will keep taking notes and watching the videos day by day.

### Day 3:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced more of Duolingo's "basics 1" and "basics 2" course. Watched the 3rd video of Billy Go's series as well. I learned that Korean has a set of basic verbs that indicate existence. Two of the most common are 있다 and 없다:

| Korean               | English                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 있다                 | there is/to exist/to be located             |
| 없다                 | there is not/to not exist/to not be located |
| 빵이 있습니다.       | There is bread.                             |
| 빵이 없습니다.       | There is no bread.                          |
| 제가 공원에 있습니다 | I am in the park                            |

These two verbs also translate to "to have". The basic sentence is similar to the ones above, with the item marked with 이/가, the owner marked with 은/는. Locations are marked with 에.

| Korean              | English              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 저는 차가 있습니다. | I have a car.        |
| 저는 차가 없습니다. | I do not have a car. |

You can even use 있다 and 없다 to form adjectives:

| Korean | English                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 맛있다 | delicious/tasty (when used with food)           |
| 맛없다 | not delicious, disgusting (when used with food) |

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of using these sets of verbs for their meanings. Definitely need a refresher on vocabulary. More letters of 한글 learned!

### Day 4:

**Today's Progress:** 예, 안녕하세요! There are two words for thank you, 고맙다 and 감사하다. 감사하다, a Sino-Korean word and has a more formal connotation. 고맙다 is a native Korean word which is less formal.

죄송하다 is a formal form of an apology. 실례하다 is a small apology like when you're trying to get past someone politely.

Nice to meet you can be translate to 만나서 반갑습니다 or "Glad to have met."

**Thoughts:** The phrases contain complex syllable blocks so the pronunciation is tricky.

### Day 5:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced basics 1, basics 2, and phrases. Also watched Billy Go's Korean video for day 5, Learning 한글 Part 3 More Vowels.

**Thoughts:** For the alphabet, sheer repetition is key for getting the stroke order and pronunciation down. However still complex syllable blocks in words are difficult to guess and will take time.

### Day 6:

**Today's Progress:** Made alphabet 1, alphabet 2, and basics 1 all legendary in Duolingo. Also, watched Billy Go's video for day 6, Learning 한글 Part 4 More Syllables, while taking notes. Quick tip for four letter syllable blocks: when one of the two bottom syllables is ㄹ and the following syllable block doesn't start with ㅇ you can usually not pronounce the ㄹ.

**Thoughts:** Basics 2 and phrases are a tough hurdle in Duolingo to get over. However, with enough consistent practice I should be able to get them down.

### Day 7:

**Today's Progress:** Made the basics 2 skill on Duolingo legendary finally after many attempts. After I practiced phrases a bit more. Also, watched Billy Go's video for day 7, Learning 한글 Part 5 Double and Strong Consonants.

When pronouncing consonants vs their strong and doubled versions hold a piece of tissue paper in front of your mouth. Strong consonants (different from double consonants) sound the same as their normal versions but just with more force.

- When pronouncing regular consonants the tissue paper should move noticeably
- When pronouncing strong consonants the tissue paper should move more noticeably
- When pronouncing double consonants the tissue paper should not move because of the tenseness

| Korean | English           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 불     | fire              |
| 뿔     | horns             |
| 풀     | 'grass' or 'glue' |

**Thoughts:** So far it's been hard to remember adjectives like 의미, 매력, and 인기. My goal is to get all 1st checkpoint skills on Duolingo to legendary. After that I think getting everything gold should be good.

### Day 8:

**Today's Progress:** Started working on adjectives on Duolingo. However, in Korean you mainly use descriptive verbs instead of adjectives. Also, watched Billy Go's video for day 8, Learning 한글 Part 6 Diphthongs. We can form the names of the Korean alphabet by taking the consonant, adding ㅣ to form a syllable block with the consonant, and then making a second syllable block with 으 and that consonant:

| Consonant | Name      |
| --------- | --------- |
| ㄱ        | 기역 (\*) |
| ㄴ        | 니은      |
| ㄷ        | 디귿 (\*) |
| ㄹ        | 리을      |
| ㅁ        | 미음      |
| ㅂ        | 비읍      |
| ㅅ        | 시옷 (\*) |
| ㅇ        | 이응      |
| ㅈ        | 지읒      |

For the doubled versions you can just add 쌍 before the name. Vowels can be read as-is with the consonant ㅇ.

These three dipthongs have the same pronunciation: ㅙ, ㅚ, and ㅞ.

**Thoughts:** Dipthongs can be tricky but with enough practice and exposure they won't be bad at all.

### Day 9:

**Today's Progress:** Watched Billy Go's video for day 9, Sound Change Rules for 한글. This one was quite the long video. In the video, they talk about how sound change rules help with Korean's efficiency in pronunciation. Although tricky at first, they'll be learned naturally.

**Pronouncing the bottom**

When a syllable ends with a consonant that cannot be pronounced as-is; they are pronounced as ㄷ:

- 만 --> 맏
- 밌 --> 맏
- 갖 --> 갇
- 및 --> 믿
- 밭 --> 받
- 낳 --> 낟

Consonants that can be pronounced as-is: ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, and ㅇ.

**Pronouncing the bottom with strong/doubles**

These consonants become pronounced as their normal versions:

- 겪 --> 격
- 부엌 --> 부억
- 잎 --> 입

**Between two syllables**

When the 1st syllable ends with any consonant sound (besides ㅁ, ㄴ, or ㄹ).

And the 2nd syllable begins with any of the following 5 consonants: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, and ㅈ.

You pronounce the 2nd syllable's consonant as a double consonant:

- 학교 --> 학꾜
- 받다 --> 받따
- 았던 --> 얻떤
- 백보 --> 백뽀
- 국수 --> 국쑤
- 먹자 --> 먹짜
- 없다 --> 업따

These are just small examples from the pronunciation video out of 14 general rules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbOWbrPoW00

**Thoughts:** What I previously thought was the most difficult part of learning Korean became a bit easier. Syllable blocks are intimidating but with some general pronunciation rules it's very helpful.

### Day 10:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced essential phrases like hello and goodbye. Fun fact: Korea was actually one big country until after the Korean war (1950-1953). Korean sentence structure is subject, object, verb or SOV. In english we have subject verb, object or SVO.

- 안녕 = hello/goodbye (friends and people same age or younger)
- 안녕하세요 = hello (anyone else)
- 안녕히 가세요 = goodbye (anyone else and they're leaving)
- 안녕히 계세요 = goodbye (anyone else and they're staying and you're leaving)

**Thoughts:** I've heard that Korean actually has a lot of formal levels. In French I'm only really familiar with 2. Italian has more or less 3. English has 1 but you can just speak with more polite language.

### Day 11:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced how to introduce myself.
저는 막스예요! You'd use ...이에요 if your name ended with a consonant.

**Thoughts:** Saying my name is pretty cool!

### Day 12:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced how to say thank you and please.

감사합니다!

주세요 can be used in most situations to mean please. For example, 돼지갈비 2인분 주세요 = Two portions of pork ribs, please.

**Thoughts:** Hello, goodbye, please, and thank you. These are essential to know and it feels good I've got them down.

### Day 13:

**Today's Progress:** Learned how to say excuse me in different situations. Also, practiced more alphabet stroke order.
