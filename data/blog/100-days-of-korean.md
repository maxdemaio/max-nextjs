I've always wanted to learn Korean to take my sister who was born in South Korea on a trip there. My goal is to reach a basic level in Korean. This blog contains my language learning progress for 100 days! I'll be using [https://duolingo.com](https://duolingo.com/), [https://youtube.com](https://youtube.com/), and other resources to help me learn. For more info on the challenge definitely check out my Twitter bot, [thelangbot](https://github.com/maxdemaio/thelangbot). With the help of my Twitter bot and the language learning community I'm hoping to achieve my language goals. 가자!

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress:** I received a free year of Duolingo Plus for being a volunteer events host for French! Jumped into learning the Korean alphabet, 한글. Unlike English it's organized into syllable blocks of two to four letters.

**Thoughts:** Learning how syllable blocks sound how to write them and will be beneficial down the line. Knowing how consonants and vowels sound will be helpful despite edge cases.

### Day 2:

**Today's Progress:** Studied Duolingo's "basics 1" course and a little bit of "basics 2". Found a sweet playlist with 100 videos to learn Korean, 멋있습니다! [Billy Go’s Beginner Korean Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx0yyQqkpqo&list=PLbFrQnW0BNMUkAFj4MjYauXBPtO3I9O_k).

**Thoughts:** Before moving on in the Duolingo tree I'm going to try and make the skill/course at least golden or legendary. Will keep taking notes and watching the videos day by day.

### Day 3:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced more of Duolingo's "basics 1" and "basics 2" course. Watched the 3rd video of Billy Go's series as well. I learned that Korean has a set of basic verbs that indicate existence. Two of the most common are 있다 and 없다:

| Korean               | English                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 있다                 | there is/to exist/to be located             |
| 없다                 | there is not/to not exist/to not be located |
| 빵이 있습니다.       | There is bread.                             |
| 빵이 없습니다.       | There is no bread.                          |
| 제가 공원에 있습니다 | I am in the park                            |

These two verbs also translate to "to have". The basic sentence is similar to the ones above, with the item marked with 이/가, the owner marked with 은/는. Locations are marked with 에.

| Korean              | English              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 저는 차가 있습니다. | I have a car.        |
| 저는 차가 없습니다. | I do not have a car. |

You can even use 있다 and 없다 to form adjectives:

| Korean | English                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 맛있다 | delicious/tasty (when used with food)           |
| 맛없다 | not delicious, disgusting (when used with food) |

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the hang of using these sets of verbs for their meanings. Definitely need a refresher on vocabulary. More letters of 한글 learned!

### Day 4:

**Today's Progress:** 예, 안녕하세요! There are two words for thank you, 고맙다 and 감사하다. 감사하다, a Sino-Korean word and has a more formal connotation. 고맙다 is a native Korean word which is less formal.

죄송하다 is a formal form of an apology. 실례하다 is a small apology like when you're trying to get past someone politely.

Nice to meet you can be translate to 만나서 반갑습니다 or "Glad to have met."

**Thoughts:** The phrases contain complex syllable blocks so the pronunciation is tricky.

### Day 5:

**Today's Progress:** Practiced basics 1, basics 2, and phrases. Also watched Billy Go's Korean video for day 5, Learning 한글 Part 3 More Vowels.

**Thoughts:** For the alphabet, sheer repetition is key for getting the stroke order and pronunciation down. However still complex syllable blocks in words are difficult to guess and will take time.

### Day 6:

**Today's Progress:** Made alphabet 1, alphabet 2, and basics 1 all legendary in Duolingo. Also, watched Billy Go's video for day 6, Learning 한글 Part 4 More Syllables, while taking notes. Quick tip for four letter syllable blocks: when one of the two bottom syllables is ㄹ and the following syllable block doesn't start with ㅇ you can usually not pronounce the ㄹ.

**Thoughts:** Basics 2 and phrases are a tough hurdle in Duolingo to get over. However, with enough consistent practice I should be able to get them down.

### Day 7:

**Today's Progress:** Made the basics 2 skill on Duolingo legendary finally after many attempts. After I practiced phrases a bit more. Also, watched Billy Go's video for day 7, Learning 한글 Part 5 Double and Strong Consonants.

When pronouncing consonants vs their strong and doubled versions hold a piece of tissue paper in front of your mouth. Strong consonants (different from double consonants) sound the same as their normal versions but just with more force.

- When pronouncing regular consonants the tissue paper should move noticeably
- When pronouncing strong consonants the tissue paper should move more noticeably
- When pronouncing double consonants the tissue paper should not move because of the tenseness

| Korean | English           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 불     | fire              |
| 뿔     | horns             |
| 풀     | 'grass' or 'glue' |

**Thoughts:** So far it's been hard to remember adjectives like 의미, 매력, and 인기. My goal is to get all 1st checkpoint skills on Duolingo to legendary. After that I think getting everything gold should be good.

### Day 8:

**Today's Progress:** Started working on adjectives on Duolingo. However, in Korean you mainly use descriptive verbs instead of adjectives. Also, watched Billy Go's video for day 8, Learning 한글 Part 6 Diphthongs.
